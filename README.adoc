= Edgar

Edgar is a small Kotlin/JVM library to read the `.po` files used by
https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/[GNU gettext].

Given a directory structure such as:

    translations
      ↳ en-GB
          ↳ messages.po
          ↳ help.po
      ↳ en-US
          ↳ messages.po
          ↳ help.po
      ↳ de
          ↳ messages.po
          ↳ help.po

You can use Edgar with just a few lines of code:

[source,kotlin]
----
Edgar.init(Paths.get("translations))
Edgar.setLanguage("en-GB")

println(Edgar.tr("Hello world!"))
println(Edgar.tr("help", "This is loaded from help.po"))
----

Edgar currently supports:

* Multiple domains
* Multi-line messages
* Escaped characters (e.g. nested quotes, new lines)
* Caching of all loaded domains
* Runtime changing of language via additional `setLanguage` calls

It does *not* currently support:

* Plural forms
